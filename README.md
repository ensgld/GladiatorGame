My goal in this game was to create various areas where the player could perform different actions, and to use pointers and data structures to facilitate transitions between rooms while introducing scenario-based changes in certain attributes. To achieve this, I defined a Player entity along with its capabilities and characteristics, including the locations they can travel to and the activities they can perform upon arrival.
For example, I began the game’s narrative by placing the character in a “Forest Area,” from which they can freely move to other locations: the Arena, Home, Market, and Training Room. Each area is designed to offer unique experiences and influences on the player. In the Training Room, the player can practice and improve their skills; in the Market, they can purchase new items with gold; at Home, they can rest and recover; and in the Arena, they can participate in tournaments. Winning a tournament grants the player certain rewards, contributing to a simple underlying storyline.
Regarding the Market, I implemented a system that allows players to buy specific equipment using gold. They can then access their inventory to use these items whenever they wish. Of course, the player can choose not to use an item even after purchasing it. Each item provides different benefits, such as boosting strength or increasing health, thus adding variety and strategic depth to the game.
Finally, I introduced a Creature structure to create diverse types of enemies. In the Training Room, players can battle these creatures to prepare for tournaments. They can either choose specific creatures or opt for a randomly generated one, thereby enhancing the variety of encounters. Each creature type comes with distinct stats, encouraging the player to develop strategies and improve their skills.
In summary, the game is composed of different areas, activities, items, and creatures, all working together to offer a dynamic and engaging player experience.
